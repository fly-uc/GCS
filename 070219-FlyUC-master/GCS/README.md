#FLYUC Ground Control Station
##This repository is for the ground control station software
This application is used to control and monitor the FlyUC Vehicle remotely.
The UI for the application uses the JUCE C++ library.
JUCE Documentation can be found here: https://juce.com
The software will have two methods of control.
Pilot mode lets the user pilot the vehicle using hands-on-throttle controllers
The other method of control is through programable waypoints
This readme will be updated periodically and I plan on using it as a task list

If you have any questions message me on the HUC Slack
